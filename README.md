In the master branch, you will find six homework assignments from the Scientific Computing course. Below is a brief description of each assignment.


### 01

functions for doing various matrix operations like multiplying matrices, checking if two matrices are similar, and creating rotation matrices, without using some built-in numpy functions.

ways to measure how fast these operations are and to calculate the smallest difference a computer can recognize between two numbers (machine apsilon)

### 02

functions for solving systems of linear equations, such as Gaussian elimination and Cholesky decomposition, without using certain numpy functions. 

functions for setting up and solving a tomographic reconstruction problem to create an image from measurements.

### 03

principal component analysis (PCA) and face recognition

functions that calculate eigenvectors, load images, perform PCA, project images into a PCA basis, and identify faces in test images based on trained data

### 04

implementation of Lagrange interpolation, Hermite cubic interpolation, natural cubic spline interpolation, and periodic cubic spline interpolation

### 05

Implementing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix and FFT

creating and transforming delta impulse signals, generating a tone signal, and applying a low-pass filter to a signal.

### 06

bisection method, generating Newton fractals

Gradient descent to calculate minimal area surface for giveen triangles
